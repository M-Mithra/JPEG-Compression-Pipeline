It then resizes the quantization matrix to match the block size and reverses the zigzag scanning applied during encoding to obtain the quantized blocks. After dequantizing each block by multiplying with the resized quantization matrix, the function applies the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) to each block to revert the frequency domain data to spatial data. The IDCT blocks are placed in their respective positions to reconstruct the padded image. The DC shift introduced during encoding is corrected by adding 128 to each pixel value, and the pixel values are clipped to ensure they remain within the valid range.
